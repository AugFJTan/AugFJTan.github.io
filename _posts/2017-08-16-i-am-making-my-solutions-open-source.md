This decision wasn't a tough one, but it was bound to happen anyway. I will be taking *Introduction to Programming* as part my core subjects in university very soon, but rather than breeze through this subject while I watch inexperienced students struggle to remember boilerplate code, I am making my code available to them by making it open source. I have created a public repository to upload my lab exercise solutions for this subject, which you can view [here](https://github.com/AugFJTan/COS10009_open_source_code). This repository will contain mostly C code, but I am expecting C++ to be included at some point.

Many a time, I have looked at the code produced by my coursemates and often cringed at how messy and unreadable it was. I hope to point out good programming practices and encourage the sharing of code via contributions. This may not be the most ideal approach, but it could be improved over time. Learning to write proper code takes years of practice, and it doesn't get any easier when you have to learn it under strict deadlines. I had the luxury of messing with my code, with programming being one of my hobbies. However, not everyone is passionate about programming. The sad truth is, there are people who only code for the money and don't enjoy it at all.

If you aren't taking *Introduction to Programming* in my university, you can still contribute your solutions to specific questions if you are interested. It is a pity that students don't learn programming earlier on during their primary or secondary schooling. I myself had to teach myself programming when I was in secondary school. Anyway, it is never too late to learn proper programming. Hopefully you will learn new things alongside me as I progress through the semester. Happy Coding, everyone!
