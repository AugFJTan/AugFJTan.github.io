I wanted to try out blogging through GitHub Pages, and here's what I got. I'll probably update it from time to time to ensure I get what I want. So that means this is pretty much a work in progress. 

In the meantime, do admire the beauty of C code:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("Hello New World!");
	
	return 0;
}
```
