Is it necessary for a programmer to speak in technical terms when speaking about computers? Technically, yes. However, there are still many people who are not as computer literate as they should be. In this age of mobile devices, most of us carry immense computing power in our pockets and laptop bags; power that was unimaginable just a few decades ago. Unfortunately, the ability to utilize these devices is limited to those who seek knowledge beyond the fancy GUIs so prominent in today's desktops.

Frankly, I prefer to use the technical mumbo-jumbo than use watered down language that fails to convey any important information. For example, you'd rather have *Linux* tell you that your program caused a **segmentation fault** than *Windows* tell you that your program crashed for **no reason**. Being a programmer can be both a blessing and a curse in 2017, as you would have to dig through a myraid of resources just to find anything relevant or of interest.

Alright. Enough with my long introduction. This blog is meant for mostly intermediate programmers who have gotten their feet wet in programming and may just want to read something interesting. My topics range from practical programming, concepts on computer science and maybe some thoughts on robotics (I am currently pursuing a degree in Robotics and Mechatronics). I'll try to post articles often as I can, but I can't guarantee anything. That being said, I hope you enjoy reading this blog as much as I have setting it up. Happy Coding!
